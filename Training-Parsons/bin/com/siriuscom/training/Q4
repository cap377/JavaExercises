1. A Set would be best as it contains no duplicates.
2. A Map would be best as it doesn't allow repeats and you could grab the first name only from an employee in the map.
3. A List would be best as it allows duplicates, which we would have duplicates of names.
4. A Queue is best for a waiting list as it implements FIFO.
